# HSCButton
I happened to know HSCButton in a project from my friend. It's very easy, but nice to use. Unfortunately, I didn't find it on GitHub. There might be some people like me who wants to find HSCButton on GitHub, and native Swift edition may be needed. So I create it. Hope it helps.

As I know, HSCButton is originally created by **zhangmh** on 12-7-20.
